# Web-Browser
hello everyone here today, we will be creating our own web browser this is a basic project for beginners,
but i want each and everyone to enjoy it.

In this project we used the following modules-
1)PyQtWebEngine
2)sys
3)PyQt5

Basically in this project we added a new windw which will be running in our computer.In this window there will be a fully automatic
working web browser just like google.
You can also customize this window by just editing it in the setApplicatinName.
